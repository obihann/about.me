{"name":"your.page","tagline":" I got fed up with [about.me](http://about.me), so I decided to create my own clone with HTML5 and SASS. Obviouslly any CMS type controls are missing however it provided me with a quick and free one page site.","body":"##Table Of Contents\r\n* [Download](#download)\r\n* [Installation](#installation)\r\n* [Credits](#credits)\r\n* [License](#license)\r\n\r\n##Download\r\nOur beta release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/obihann/your.page/archive/v.01-beta.tar.gz) or you can clone the repo like so:\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/obihann/your.page.git\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n###(Step 0.1) Install Ruby\r\nIf you don't already have it, check out RVM (https://rvm.io/)\r\n\r\n###(Step 1) Install Bundler\r\nBundler is a handy tool to help keep track of the necessary Ruby packages\r\n\r\n\tgem install bundler\r\n\tbundle install\r\n\r\nWhat did I justt install?!?!? Basically just [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), and a few plugins for it([Compass]((http://compass-style.org/), [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), and [rgbapng](https://github.com/aaronrussell/compass-rgbapng))\r\n\r\n###(Step 1.1) Install Node\r\nIf you don't already have Node (http://nodejs.org/), you have to check it out! Seriosuly, if you don't this just won't work. \r\n\r\n###(Step 2) Install Grunt\r\nGrunt (http://gruntjs.com/) is a fun Node tool that manages the project, refreshes dynamically, and tells us when were being extra sexy (ok, that might just be in my head... but I am right?)\r\n\t\r\n\tnpm install -g grunt-cli\r\n\tnpm install\r\n\r\n###(Step 4) Install eveyrthing else\r\nRun the site (finally!). You should have already noticed that the un-complied code is in app, and a example is in public, which is where\r\nyou should be compiling too. \r\n\r\n\tgrunt\r\n\t\r\nNow thats its running, feel free to fork this and make your own, have fun and show off yourself. If you area really up for it\r\nmy next step for this is better integration with github, possibly running it direclty and using jekyll. I want to avoid any \r\nback end server language such as PHP, or a database system as both of these will make this project much closer to a CMS than what it \r\nwas inteded, just a basic one page introduction site.\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) - It makes coding CSS much easier\r\n* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - An amazing CSS framework for SASS\r\n* [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) - A great responsive framework\r\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - An awesome tool to simplify builds\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis tool is protected by the [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\r\n\r\nCopyright [Jeffrey Hann](http://jeffreyhann.ca/) 2013\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
